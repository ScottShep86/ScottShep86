#### 🧑‍💻 About me

<p>I was born and raised in Croydon, United Kingdom but moved to Berlin in 2011. I started my career working in the Music Industry and became a department head in an Event Managment company. In 2023 I decided to move into Web Development and graduated from a Bootcamp as Full Stack Web Development in June 2023. I am looking for a Front- or Backend Junior Web Development position.</p>
